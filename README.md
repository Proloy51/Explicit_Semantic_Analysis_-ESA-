This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a report discussing the application of Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) for semantic vector calculation and cosine similarity measurement. The notebook demonstrates the calculation of TF-IDF scores for a small collection of documents and the subsequent computation of semantic vectors. Cosine similarity is used to measure the semantic similarity between text terms such as "green crocodile" and "big crocodile".

The repository includes:

1. A Jupyter Notebook containing Python code to calculate TF-IDF, derive semantic vectors, and compute cosine similarity.

2. A report in PDF format that explains the process of TF-IDF computation, ESA, and includes the corresponding handwritten solution and mathematical explanations.
